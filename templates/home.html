  <h1 strong>Verse of the Month</h1>
    <p>
      1 That which was from the beginning,
that which we have heard, that which we
have seen with our eyes, that which we
saw, and our hands touched, concerning
theWordoflife 2 (andthe life was revealed,
and we have seen, and testify, and declare
to you the life, the eternal life, which was
with the Father, and was revealed to us);
3 that which we have seen and heard we
declare to you, that you also may have
fellowship with us. Yes, and our fellowship
is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus
Christ.* 4And we write these things to you,
that our joy may be fulfilled.
